> all about axios 
 - axios use to make http request form any API
 - Axios is lightweight package and use to make
   HTTP requests in Any Javascript Library like
   React, Angular or Vue. Axios makes it easy to
   send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints
   and perform CRUD operations. If you use Fetch method
   in Javascript, Axios is the “Easy to use” Version
   of Fetch

 > what is cross-domain-error ????

 > all about reducers and how this works ???

 >  const fetchProducts = async () => {
      const { data } = await axios.get("/api/products");
      setProducts(data);
    }; 
    here we want to fetch data from http://localhost:5000
    but if we do then it will cause "cross domain error"
    because when we don't give any "localhost" in this case it
    will request from "localhost" of current domain which is
    "localhost:3000" so to avoid "cross domain error" we setup
    proxy in package.json

> can await be used without async function ????
